- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps, Tries)
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, etc.)
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Hash Tables and Hashing Techniques
- Dynamic Programming Approaches
- Miscellaneous Algorithms (Greedy, Divide and Conquer, etc.)
